6. donuts:
INPUT an INT count of a number of donuts, OUTPUT a string
of the form 'Number of donuts: <count>', where <count> is the number
input. However, if the count is 10 or more, then use the word 'many'
instead of the actual count.
So donuts(5) outputs 'Number of donuts: 5'
and donuts(23) outputs 'Number of donuts: many'

DECLARE Count : INTEGER

Count <-- 0

INPUT("Enter the number of donuts: ", Count)
IF Count < 10 AND Count > 0 then
    OUTPUT("There are ", Count," donuts" )
    ELSE OUTPUT("There are many donuts")
EndIf
